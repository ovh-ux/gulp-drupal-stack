This stack core is to be included in your main project and sets up many Gulp tasks that can work in many flexible ways by passing in different `config` objects, which can be based off of `gulpfile.default.yml` (and is merged with).


## Features

- SCSS => CSS compiling with LibSass, PostCSS, linting, CSScomb(x), and SourceMaps
- JS compiling via Babel, linting and aggregation
- webpack module bundling
- Drupal file watching to trigger Drush cache clears
- Copy any files to an other location
- Sprite generator (with Retina Display support)
- SVG Icon Support (generation of `sprite.svg` file as a collection of symbol wich are expected to be implemented with `<use>` https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/use )  
More info see doc.
- SVG clean/optimization illustration type 
[Deprecated]
- SVG => Font Icons compiling with support for adding mixins and classes to SCSS along with a demo page

All is easily configurable by changing values in your `gulpfile.yml` file in your project. These values are merged into the `gulpfile.default.yml` file - look there for the available options and defaults.
