Gulp Drupal Stack
=================

![gulp-drupal-stack-banner](banner.png)

This stack core is to be included in your main project and sets up many Gulp tasks that can work in many flexible ways by passing in different `config` objects, which can be based off of `gulpfile.default.yml` (and is merged with).


## Features

- SCSS => CSS compiling with LibSass, PostCSS, linting, CSScomb(x), and SourceMaps
- JS compiling via Babel, linting and aggregation
- Pattern Lab Twig compiling & BrowserSync live reload and style injection
- webpack module bundling
- SVG sprite generation with symbol for utility icons
- SVG clean for illutration type
- SVG => Font Icons compiling with support for adding mixins and classes to SCSS along with a demo page
- Drupal file watching to trigger Drush cache clears
- Copy any files to an other location
- Sprite generator (with Retina Display support)

All is easily configurable by changing values in your `gulpfile.yml` file in your project. These values are merged into the `gulpfile.default.yml` file - look there for the available options and defaults.
